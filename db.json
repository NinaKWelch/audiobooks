But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\" And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \"Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\" and sometimes, \"Do bats eat cats?\" for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \"Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\" when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.",
